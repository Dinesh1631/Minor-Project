SER is a research field that aims to develop systems that can automatically recognize emotions
from speech. This is a difficult task because emotions are complex and can be expressed in
many different ways through language. However, SER can be a valuable tool in fields as
diverse as psychology, speech therapy, and customer service. The proposed project uses
machine learning techniques to develop his SER system. Machine learning is a type of artificial
intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly
programmed. In this case, a machine learning model is trained on a dataset of speech samples
labeled with the emotions expressed. Using this tagged data, the model can learn to recognize
emotions in new audio samples. This project uses different audio functions to train a machine
learning model. These qualities include pitch, rhythm and prosody. Pitch is the frequency of a
speaker's voice and can be used to indicate emotions such as happiness, sadness, or anger.
Rhythm is the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in speech that can be used to indicate
emotions such as excitement, boredom, and frustration. Prosody is the overall melody of the
speaker's voice and can be used to indicate emotions such as confidence, fear, and sincerity.
This project uses deep learning and iterative neural networks to train a machine learning model.
Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from
data. An iterative neural network is a type of deep learning network specifically designed to
process continuous data such as speech. This project has the potential to contribute significantly
to the SER field. The proposed system is one of the first to use deep learning and recurrent
neural networks for SER. This could significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of the
SER system. Additionally, this project provides valuable insight into the relationship between
emotion and language. This information could potentially be used to design new SER systems
and improve our understanding of emotions in general. Some of the potential benefits of the
proposed project are listed below. Improved accuracy and reliability of SER systems. New
insights into the relationship between emotion and language. Improved understanding of
emotions in general. A valuable tool for researchers and professionals in fields such as
psychology and speech therapy
